# Image Analyzer Bot with Gemini

This repository contains the code for an **Image Analyzer Bot** that uses the **Gemini model** to analyze and provide judgments on clicked pictures. The bot is designed to classify, evaluate, and give feedback on images based on predefined criteria, making it useful for various applications such as content moderation, quality assessment, or simply providing insights on visual content.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies images into different categories (e.g., landscapes, portraits, objects).
- **Image Quality Assessment**: Analyzes the quality of the image based on parameters like brightness, sharpness, and composition.
- **Contextual Judgments**: Provides feedback on the image based on context or specific requirements (e.g., identifying if the image meets certain standards).
- **Gemini Model Integration**: Leverages the power of the Gemini model to generate judgments and analyze images with high accuracy.

## Key Components

- **Gemini Model**: Uses advanced deep learning techniques for analyzing visual content and providing contextual insights.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Images are processed for optimal analysis by resizing, normalizing, and adjusting contrast and brightness.
- **Feedback System**: Outputs results in the form of ratings or comments based on the analysis.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Gemini Model**: For advanced image analysis and judgment.
- **Python**: Core language for the bot's development.
- **OpenCV/Pillow**: For image processing tasks.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Frameworks for running the Gemini model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagdishdas/Image_Analyzer.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or integrate the **Gemini model** if not already included.

### Running the Bot

1. Start the Flask or FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Upload an image via the web interface or API, and the bot will analyze and return judgments.

## Usage

- Upload images through the API or the web interface.
- The bot will provide a classification, quality score, or feedback based on the image content.
- You can configure the analysis criteria based on your needs.
